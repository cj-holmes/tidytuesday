```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  echo = TRUE, 
  fig.width = 9,
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width="100%"
  )
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

A quick look at the data set
```{r}
d <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2020-07-14")[[1]]
```

```{r}
glimpse(d)
```

First thought, what is the difference in time between when an astronaut is first selected and when they go on their first mission? How does it vary by nationality?
```{r}
d %>% 
  filter(mission_number == 1) %>% # first mission
  mutate(age_at_selection = year_of_selection - year_of_birth,
         age_at_first_mission = year_of_mission - year_of_birth,
         diff = age_at_first_mission - age_at_selection) %>% 
  group_by(nationality) %>% 
  filter(n() > 20) %>% # Select high count nationalities
  gather(k, v, age_at_selection, age_at_first_mission, diff) %>% 
  mutate(k_pretty = case_when(k == "age_at_selection" ~ "Age at selection year",
                              k == "age_at_first_mission" ~ "Age at first mission",
                              k == "diff" ~ "Difference",
                              TRUE ~ "Error")) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(v, ..density.., fill=k_pretty), 
                 position = "identity", 
                 alpha=1/2, binwidth = 1, center=0)+
  facet_wrap(~nationality, scales = "free_y", ncol=1)+
  scale_fill_viridis_d("")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=scales::pretty_breaks(10))+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  labs(title = "First mission - distribution of age at selection-year and age at mission-year",
       subtitle = "Facetted by the two biggest astronaut nationalities",
       x = "Age [years]",
       y = "Density estimate")
